        <h1>Diary of a photographer </h1>
        <h2> My name is PurityJohn, <i>a photographer based in benin city.</i> <br> Photography has been my 
        hobby since i was young,
        I really can't <br> explain the joy i get whenever i capture a memory for someone 
        and they're happy  <br>or how <big>beautiful</big> an image  <ins>taken rightly</ins> makes me feel.</h2>
        <h3>In all i love receiving payments for my passion cause nobody send <mark>your papa</mark> for this country</h3>
        <p>In all i'm grateful to Bishop and the CWB team, <br> 
        for giving myself and every participant the opportunity to code.</p>
        <h4>Thanks and God bless!</h4>
